Freedom from addiction; freedom from hopelessness; freedom from depression; freedom from lies; freedom from a life without purpose. The list goes on.

Anywho.. Tyler was invited by some friends that he met from a church young adult group he’s been going to. He’s suffered for a long time from a shoulder injury from sports, specifically cannot raise his arm above his shoulder. This has been something Tyler has dealt with for month after month, coping and strengthening other areas of his body as we naturally do. Tyler also works for an Urgent Care and has been receiving medical attention in hopes to be relieved of his severe pain.</p><p>As the night went on and Tyler was worshiping the Lord, something changed. The song “Healing is Here” began to play. Tyler began to hash it out with the Big Guy.</p><p>“Lord, could you heal me? I receive it.” As Tyler began to pray he felt his whole shoulder and arm feel warm an instantly raised it up and cry out to the Lord. Now note, Tyler has not been able to raise his arm in months, this should be impossible or at least EXTREMELY painful. He was healed. 
</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>Tyler’s faith and trust in the Lord was built up immensely. A loving Father watchin out for His son. He knows our pain; Physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually. He wants to walk with you through it.  Even more so, He wants to heal you. AND EVEN MORE SO, he wants to restore you fully.</p><p> “I know I’m healed. I know it. I believe. God is all over this,” Tyler told me. 
</p><p>What would our lives look like if we walked knowing we are healed?</p><p>What kind of risks would we take for the Lord?</p><p>But its one thing to know that God is a healer; to hear about it, read about it
     
         (It IS a part of who He is, HIS CHARACTER. Which is the best ever.)</p><p>But to believe it. To live in expectation of restoration; to not even question what God is capable of in your own life. Then to wake up every day and believe that all over again.</p><p>To be like the two blind men the Bible talks about in Matthew,</p><p>“Jesus asked them, ‘Do you believe that I am able to do this?’ ‘Yes, Lord,’ they replied. Then he touched their eyes and said, ‘According to your faith let it be done to you’; and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, ‘See that no one knows about this.’ But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.” Matthew 9:27-29</p><picture>
